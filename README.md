The Awesome Antivirus Program works by not allowing Internet Explorer to run. 

This program is part joke, part anti virus.

I've found that a good portion of viruses I encounter are Internet Explorer plugins or addons. I've also found that for some people installing a new browser isn't good enough, they will still try to use Internet Explorer.

Hopefully this program will help people break their Internet Explorer habits!
