==========================

The Awesome Antivirus Program works by not allowing Internet Explorer to run. 

This program is part joke, part anti virus.

I've found that a good potion of viruses I encounter are Internet Explorer plugins or addons. I've also found that for some people installing a new browser isn't good enough. They will still try to use Internet Explorer.

Hopefully this program will educate people, and help break their Internet Exploring habits!
